String.match():Match a regular expression passed as an argument against the calling string. If a match is found, it returns an object with three properties: the matched substring, the index it was found at, and the input (i.e., the initial string); if no match is found, it returns null.
String.normalize():Returns a string containing the Unicode Normalization Form of the calling string's value. The argument must be one of the following:"
                                                            "NFC": Normalization Form Canonical Composition. This is the default in the event that no argument is given.
                                                            "NFD": Normalization Form Canonical Decomposition.
                                                            "NFKC": Normalization Form Compatibility Composition.
